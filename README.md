TODO
====

1) Modify emulatorSetup.sh
--------------------------

   -> Fix some of it's variables (they aren't outputting).
   -> Pass some of it's variables to EmulateUart.c to automate memory map better.

2) Create Testing.c/Testing.h files to store functions that test parts of the emulator.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Add more ideas as they come!
-------------------------------
