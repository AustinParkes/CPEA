Configurable Peripheral Emulator for ARM
========================================

TODO
----

1) Modify emulatorSetup.sh
   - Fix some of it's variables (they aren't outputting).
   - Pass some of it's variables to EmulateUart.c to automate memory map better. (Can pass through files)

2) Create Testing.c/Testing.h files to store functions that test parts of the emulator.

3) Add TOML config file and C file that can parse it and store variables
